We use the code artists.forEach loop.\nIt’s like making a list, and for each artist in our list (the “artists” array), we do the same thing:\nWe create a new row to represent each artist, and we call it “newRow.” It’s like adding a new line to our list.\nInside that new row, create three cells to put the artist’s details. Label the names: “nameCell,” “birthYearCell,” and “linkCell.” These cells are separate columns in our list.\nIn the “nameCell,” write down the artist’s name. In the “birthYearCell,” put their birth year. And in the “linkCell,” add a link to their YouTube video. So, we’re filling in our list with the artist’s name, birth year, and a link to their video.\nWe do this for every artist in our list, and as we go through the loop, we keep adding new rows with the artist’s details. It’s building our list one artist at a time.\nSo, this loop helps us create a table with all the artists and their information; making the table complete.\n\n\ninput.txt\n\nartists.forEach((artist) =&gt; {\n  const newRow = table.insertRow();\n  const nameCell = newRow.insertCell(0);\n  const birthYearCell = newRow.insertCell(1);\n  const linkCell = newRow.insertCell(2);\n\n  nameCell.innerText = artist.name;\n  birthYearCell.innerText = artist.birthYear;\n  linkCell.innerHTML = `&lt;a href=\"${artist.link}\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;${artist.link}&lt;/a&gt;`;\n});"
