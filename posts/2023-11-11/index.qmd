# Intro

The minor enhencement I made for my website was putting an icon in the top address bar.


# Implementing the Icon

First you need to get the picture that you want to use for the icon. In my case I used this picture.


<img src= "/images/image0.jpeg"
style="float: center; margin 3px 0px 3px 12px;"
width= 250>

After getting my image, located in my `images` folder, In my `quarto.yml` document under the `website` area, I put the favicon along with the image. That looks something like this.

```.js

website:
  title: "Elijah Peake's Website Warmup"
  site-path: "/warmup-elijah-peake/"
  favicon: images/logo.jpeg
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.qmd
        text: About 
      - href: articles/index.qmd
        text: Articles
      - href: posts/index.qmd
        text: Blog
---
```
Doing this allows my website to have its very own icon.
