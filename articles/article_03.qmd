title: Major Enhancement
---

The major enhancement I decided to do was to customize my css files. The changes that i made include making a custome theme for my navbar as well as changing how the words look.

## The Color for the navbar

The color I chose for thr navbar was a shade of red.

```.js
.navbar {
  background-color: rgb(184, 29, 81);
}
```

## The styling for the navbar
The code below modifies the words on the navbar.

```.js
.navbar {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: normal;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```
* `font-family`- This code changes the font for the text to Arial.
* `font-weight` - Changes the text to become bold
* `font-style` - Changes the text so it becomes italicied
* `font-size` - changes the font size so it becomes 16 pixels
* `line-height` - defines the space between the navbar and the text
