## About Me
My names Elijah. I'm a student at Georgetown college set to graduate in 2026. I am majoring in Biology and minoring in computer science.

## Early Life to Now
I'm from Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. I lived there for about 10 years spending most of my time on my grandparents farm. I moved to Georgetown during my 5th grade year and have lived here ever since. I attended Scott County High School and graduated in 2022. In my free time I spend time hanging out with my friends or playing video games.
